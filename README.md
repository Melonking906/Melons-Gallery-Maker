## How to build:
* Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed on your system
* Clone the repository and open a Git Bash/Terminal within the repo root
* Run: `corepack enable` as admin
* Run: `yarn install`
* Run: 'yarn run dist' to build an exicutable for your system
* Check the "dist" folder for your new exe/app

## Troubleshooting:

Linux users:
Run "apt install libvips" before trying to run the AppImage

Mac (Intel) users:
Run "brew install vips" before trying to run the app
